1: You want to pull changes from github manually because you want to know when and what changes were made. If it automatically added the changes it might break the code or leave you not knowing what caused a bug.
2: A fork is when you clone someone elses repository on github and still link back to it so they get creddit for the original. this is good if you want to add some changes and send it back to them.
	
A clone is just a copy of someones repository that you have save to your local machine. it will not have a link to the original unless you specically add it.

Branches are used when you want to work on a diffferent feature that might not be ready for the main branch.
3: The bennifit of having a copy of the last know state of the remote stored locally would be if you were going somewhere without an internet connection you could work on a new branch without imeadiatly working from the latest build.
4: Without gitHub it would be very difficult to collaborate with different people because you would have to be constantly emailing people with current commits. I'm not really sure if there is another way to do it. merging the code to would be a problem. gitHub is a very useful tool.
5: You would want to make changes on a seperate branch if you were working on a new feature that you didnt want to be live yet or that wasnt ready yet. this keeps it so you can have a stable working version while you play around with new ideas and features.
